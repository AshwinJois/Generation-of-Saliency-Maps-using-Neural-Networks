# Saliency-Maps
Generation of Saliency Maps Using Neural Networks

The Human eyes automatically focus on the most attractive regions. This is a naturally
occurring event. It is complicated to make the computer imitate the way the human eye
does while seeing an image. One of the methods to achieve this is by training a neural
network with a sufficient amount of dataset.
Saliency Maps define each pixel's unique quality. It is the representation of the Image in
a unique manner that is easier to analyze and is also meaningful. It is an image in the form of a map where people are expected
to look irrespective of the task they are doing. Saliency Maps are usually rendered as
a heatmap. The hotness in the heatmap refers to the region of interest, whereas the
Saliency Maps refers to the probability of each pixel.
